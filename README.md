Filmo search surfaces movie information via three distinct API queries; A movie title, pagination and a movie detail search.


The web app was designed to work in two distinct stages. The first stage will allow the user to perform a movie search by querying through the API (using the s parameter). The second stage will allow the user to find movie details for each title each time it is clicked on (This was achieved by querying through the API using the t parameter).
